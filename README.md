In this project, I carried out some analysis on Boston Crime dataset, which was obtained from Crime Incident Reports, provided by Boston Police Department (BPD) Source: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system

The objective of the project is to help both residents and visitors stay safer, and Boston Police identify crime hotspots, better anticipate staffing needs and improve security in menacing areas.

These are 6 research questions for the project:

Determine the most common crimes in Boston
Determine the most dangerous time of year and in a day in Boston
Identify the places (District and Street) where crimes are most likely to be committed
Crimes related to Shooting analysis
Incidents in Boston during Covid pandemic analysis
Crimes at Northeastern University area analysis
In this project, I followed the workflow of five main stages:

Question or problem definition and hypotheses
Acquire dataset
Wrangle, prepare and cleanse the data
Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data
Visualize, report, and present the problem-solving steps and final solution

Welcome to my **Boston Crime Analysis** repository! This project is dedicated to analyzing crime data in Boston to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve public safety and awareness.

## üìö About This Project

This repository contains my analysis of crime data in Boston, utilizing various data science techniques to explore and visualize crime patterns. The goal is to gain a better understanding of crime dynamics in the city and provide actionable insights.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Data Exploration**: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and its features.
- **Visualization**: Interactive and static visualizations using Python libraries and Tableau to present crime patterns effectively.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analysis of crime trends over time, including the impact of significant events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping crime incidents to identify hotspots and spatial patterns.
