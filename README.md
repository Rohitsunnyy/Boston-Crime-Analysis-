In this project, I carried out some analysis on Boston Crime dataset, which was obtained from Crime Incident Reports, provided by Boston Police Department (BPD) Source: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system

The objective of the project is to help both residents and visitors stay safer, and Boston Police identify crime hotspots, better anticipate staffing needs and improve security in menacing areas.

These are 6 research questions for the project:

Determine the most common crimes in Boston
Determine the most dangerous time of year and in a day in Boston
Identify the places (District and Street) where crimes are most likely to be committed
Crimes related to Shooting analysis
Incidents in Boston during Covid pandemic analysis
Crimes at Northeastern University area analysis
In this project, I followed the workflow of five main stages:

Question or problem definition and hypotheses
Acquire dataset
Wrangle, prepare and cleanse the data
Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data
Visualize, report, and present the problem-solving steps and final solution
